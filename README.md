# Credit to AGMG
Huge Thanks for a super great ProModder in AGMG who share me the whole reverse scripts and allow me to publish it here,  
can't say his name here because AGMG don't allow reverse scripts, 
and what I do is just reorganize some code, and add some comments and publish it for him,
all the code is credit to him except the scripts in IBConvert folder, NicoMico only work for delete some comments and 
add some comments to understand and finally publish it.
